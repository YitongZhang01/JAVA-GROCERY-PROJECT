###Why is this project of interest to you?

- Because I found some online site have a pretty bad design of their shopping cart, and I was wondering if I could write my own program to design a shopping cart system.

- Quantity: 4 to the shopping cart

## Phase 4: Task 3
- I want to refactor the item price method in the Item class to an Abstract class. Then, I can pass the item's name as a parameter and get their price. Therefore,I don't need to repeat the code that much and improve my design to be more concise and cohesion.
